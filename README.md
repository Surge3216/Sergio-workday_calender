## Workday calender

Using Html, css and Javascript ive created a workday calender that will change through out the day, as well as save your appointments.

Using Javascript I created fuctions to save appoinments, dispay time, and make css elements change though out the day, aswell as creating a loop to display html elements needed to display time blocks.
